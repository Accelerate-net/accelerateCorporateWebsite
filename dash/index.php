							<h2>Get the most out of Technology
							<br />
							with <strong>Dash</strong> today!</h2>
							<p>Dash in simple terms is an 'e-Progress Card' - where we used technology to evaluate and analyze the students academics. It's built up on the technology stack of Accelerate, a light-weight and modern framework used to develop customised websites and mobile applications. Dash monitors your students' academic performance and sends regular reports to the parents and concerned teachers. It helps students identify their strong and weak areas so that they can take measures to improve themselves. What all the school or institution needs to do is, keep updating Dash database with all the relevant exams. Dash will get the work done for you!<br><br>Dash consists of 4 modules - a website for school which gives a digital identity globally, a web portal for school management, a portal for students and parents and a mobile application for school. It has <a href="features.php">customisable features</a> like smart library management, student profiling etc as add-ons. which makes your school and the students smart.
